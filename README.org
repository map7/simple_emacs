* Emacs

This emacs mostly uses packages in the aim to simplify the management of my emacs configuration. I use two repos:

: tromey:    http://tromey.com/elpa/
: marmalade: http://marmalade-repo.org/

NOTE: Adding tromey is a work around to getting inf-ruby & ruby-mode working together nicely through marmalade. Refer to this issue:
https://github.com/nonsequitur/inf-ruby/issues/1#issuecomment-2488656

Once this issue is resolved I recommend removing tromey as it has a heap of old packages in it.

** Requirements

Install Emacs 24.3 (stable)

1. Download http://gnu.mirror.uber.com.au/emacs/emacs-24.3.tar.gz
2. untar
3. Install requirements
   : $ sudo aptitude install build-essential xorg-dev libgtk2.0-dev libgif-dev libtiff-dev libm17n-dev libpng12-dev librsvg2-dev libotf-dev texinfo libncurses-dev automake
4. Compile
   : ./autogen.sh
   : ./configure --prefix=/opt/emacs24
   : make -j4
5. Install
   : sudo make install

Now you can uninstall any emacs you have installed through symantic (ie: emacs-snapshot)

I've tested this on ubuntu 10.04.3, Linux Mint 14 & Debian 7.1, but it should work on any Linux machine.

** Installation

Back up your .emacs.d directory
: $ mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.bak

Clone this repo
: $ git clone git://github.com/map7/simple_emacs.git ~/.emacs.d

Get git submodules (within ~/.emacs.d)
: $ git submodule init
: $ git submodule update

Start emacs and it should compile everything

** Updating packages
: package-refresh-contents
: package-update-all

** Advanced auto-complete section using Rsense

Rsense is a third party tool to help create popups in emacs for auto-complete.
: $ wget http://cx4a.org/pub/rsense/rsense-0.3.zip
: $ sudo unzip rsence-0.3 -d /opt

I added the following to my .zshrc (I recommend using ZSH for Ruby on Rails).
: export RSENSE_HOME=/opt/rsense-0.3/

Start a new shell
: $ chmod +x $RSENSE_HOME/bin/rsense
: $ ruby $RSENSE_HOME/etc/config.rb > ~/.rsense

Restart emacs and test (I usually test by typing in a string and start typing upcase).
: "test".up... (You should get a list of options)

** Gist setup (optional)
If you want to automatically post gists, list gists, etc then you have to setup a file called ./emacs.d/secrets.el with your password

: (setq gist-user-password "your-github-password")

** Package must reads

Undo Tree - http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/undo-tree
** Not included & why
MuMaMo - it's buggy and hard to debug and haml-mode suits me fine.
Ref: http://nex-3.com/posts/79-highlighting-ruby-in-haml-mode

EGG - Magit is just as good now for managing git and it's included in Marmalade so it's easier to manage.
** Other packages to consider
   deft - simple note taking, but not as good as org-mode.
